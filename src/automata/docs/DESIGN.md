# Automata Project Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design for three major features being added to the Automata project: asynchronous processing, Google Drive integration, and issue-triggered automation.

## 1. Asynchronous Processing System
*Closes issue #3*

### Architecture
- Task Queue Manager
  - Priority-based queue system
  - Task scheduling and dependency management
  - Task state management (pending, running, completed, failed)

### Components
1. Task Queue System
   - Task prioritization
   - Dependency resolution
   - Task scheduling
   - Queue management

2. Background Processing
   - Long-running task execution
   - Progress monitoring
   - Task cancellation handling
   - Resource cleanup

3. Event Notification System
   - Task completion notifications
   - Success/failure callbacks
   - Integration with existing systems

4. Error Management
   - Error handling strategies
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Error reporting

### Implementation Details
- Use async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- Implement message queue for reliable task management
- Include proper resource cleanup mechanisms
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

## 2. Google Drive Integration
*Closes issue #4*

### Architecture
- Drive Service Manager
  - Authentication handling
  - File operation coordination
  - Permission management
  - Event monitoring

### Components
1. File Operations
   - Upload/download functionality
   - File/folder listing
   - Search capabilities
   - File organization

2. Permission System
   - Access control management
   - Sharing settings
   - Ownership transfers
   - Permission verification

3. File Monitor
   - Change detection
   - Event handling
   - Version tracking
   - Change notification

4. Integration Layer
   - OAuth2 implementation
   - Token management
   - Rate limit handling
   - Batch operations

### Implementation Details
- Use Google Drive API v3
- Implement secure credential storage
- Handle API quotas and rate limits
- Support offline operations
- Add error recovery mechanisms

## 3. Issue-Triggered Automation
*Closes issue #5*

### Architecture
- Automation Controller
  - Event listening
  - Task distribution
  - Process coordination
  - Status reporting

### Components
1. Issue Event Handler
   - Webhook integration
   - Issue parsing
   - Type categorization
   - Priority assessment

2. Assignment System
   - AI assistant assignment
   - Label management
   - Initial analysis
   - Status updates

3. Response Generator
   - Code analysis
   - Change implementation
   - PR creation
   - Issue linking

4. Integration Hub
   - Slack notifications
   - Progress tracking
   - Review management
   - Status reporting

### Implementation Details
- Implement GitHub webhook handlers
- Set up secure repository access
- Add rate limiting and queuing
- Include comprehensive logging
- Implement review process integration

## Security Considerations
1. Authentication

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Component-level testing
   - Error case validation
   - Mock integration points

2. Integration Tests
   - End-to-end workflows
   - API integration testing
   - Event handling verification

3. Performance Tests
   - Load testing
   - Concurrency testing
   - Resource utilization

## Deployment Strategy
1. Phased Rollout
   - Feature flag implementation
   - Gradual enablement
   - Monitoring and validation

2. Monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics

3. Rollback Plan
   - Version control
   - State management
